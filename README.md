# nanoindentation #
This repository contains code used to derive indentation moduli from an indentation test performed according to a specific load schedule. It is currently pre-release, meaning I do not recommend anyone but myself to use this code.


### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
* Version
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up? ###
* The repository is missing the function readIBW.m. This function reads the binary files output by an Asylum Research/Oxford Instruments Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) machine. I do not own the rights to this file, so I cannot share it freely.

* The repository has been designed to be possible to run from both MATLAB and Octave. Although this is the intention, I do not guarantee that this will always work, as I develop on MATLAB.
